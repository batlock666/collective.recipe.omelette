Collective.recipe.omelette test suite
=====================================

Install a fat omelette with an egg, some packages, and a product::

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = %(test_dir)s/omelettetests.egg1
    ... parts = omelette
    ...
    ... [omelette]
    ... recipe = collective.recipe.omelette:fatty
    ... eggs = egg.with.name.different.from.contents
    ... """ % globals())
    >>> print system(buildout + ' -v')
    Installing...
    ...
    Installing omelette.
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>

Now we have everything linked together in one place, pointing at the real
locations::

    >>> import os
    >>> ls('parts')
    d omelette
    >>> cat('parts/omelette/omelettetests/ingredient.py')
    """Namespace packages can contain modules.  This is one such module."""
    >>> ls('parts/omelette/omelettetests/egg1')
    - __init__.py
    - in_egg1.txt

Make sure we didn't clobber stuff that was linked from outside the omelette
directory when we reinstalled (we needed to take extra care that this didn't
happen when using junction on Windows!)::

    >>> ls('parts/omelette/omelettetests/egg1')
    - __init__.py
    - in_egg1.txt
